# AI Learning Lab: Interactive ML Algorithm Playground

## üöÄ About The Project

AI Learning Lab is a browser-based, interactive playground designed to help users visualize and understand the workings of various fundamental supervised machine learning algorithms. Built entirely with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, this application provides a hands-on experience without requiring any complex setup or external libraries for the core algorithm implementations.

Users can:
*   Select from a range of supervised learning algorithms (k-NN, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees).
*   Generate diverse 2D datasets (Gaussian blobs, concentric circles, XOR-like patterns, linear trends, sine waves) with configurable sample sizes and noise levels.
*   Tune algorithm-specific hyperparameters in real-time.
*   Initiate model training directly in the browser.
*   Visualize the learned model:
    *   **Classifiers:** See the decision boundaries that separate classes.
    *   **Regressors:** Observe the fitted regression line.
*   Analyze model performance through key metrics like Accuracy and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
*   Gain insights from brief explanations about each algorithm.

The application features a sleek, dark-themed "AI/futuristic" user interface to enhance the learning experience.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://YOUR_USERNAME/ai-learning-lab.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd ai-learning-lab
    ```
3.  Open the `index.html` (or the main HTML file, e.g., `ai_lab_playground.html`) file in your favorite modern web browser.

No installation or build steps are required!

## üìñ Usage

1.  **Select an Algorithm:** Choose from the "SYSTEM CORE // Algorithm" dropdown.
2.  **Configure Dataset:**
    *   Select a "Dataset Matrix" type.
    *   Adjust "Sample Density" and "Signal Noise."
    *   Click "Generate Data Matrix."
3.  **Calibrate Hyperparameters:** Modify the parameters specific to the selected algorithm in the "CALIBRATION" panel.
4.  **Initiate Training:** Click the "Initiate Training" button.
5.  **Observe & Analyze:**
    *   Watch the "VISUALIZATION GRID" update with data points and the model's learned representation (decision boundary or regression line).
    *   Check the "PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS" panel for metrics like Accuracy or MSE.
    *   Read about the algorithm in the "About" section.
6.  **Experiment:** Try different algorithms, datasets, and hyperparameter combinations to see how they affect model behavior and performance. Use "System Reset" to start fresh.
